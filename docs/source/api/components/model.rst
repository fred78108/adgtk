===========================

The protocols for models provides a template for the implementation of models in the ADGTK framework. It is not required to use these protocols, but they are provided as a guide for the implementation of models in the ADGTK framework for consistency and ease of use. Similar to measurements this design approach allows for a predictable and consistent interface for models across different frameworks and libraries.
